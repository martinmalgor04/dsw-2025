  # SHIPPING COST CALCULATION
  # ===========================
  /shipping/cost:
    post:
      summary: Calculate shipping cost
      description: |
        Quotes cost for a shipment without creating any resources.
        Used by Order Management module to show shipping options to customers before purchase.
        
        Integration Flow:
        1. Order Management sends only: delivery_address + product IDs with quantities
        2. Logistics queries Stock module for EACH product:
           - GET /products/{id} → returns weight, dimensions, warehouse_postal_code
        3. Logistics calculates:
           - Total weight = sum(product.weight * quantity)
           - Total volume = sum(product dimensions * quantity)
           - Distance = from warehouse_postal_code to delivery_address.postal_code
        4. Returns estimated cost based on weight, volume, distance, and transport type
        5. NO data is persisted (quote only)

  # SHIPMENT CREATION
  # ===========================
  /shipping:
    post:
      summary: Create shipment
      description: |
        Creates a new shipment for an order with customer-selected transport method.
        
        Customer Checkout Flow:
        1. Customer adds products to cart
        2. Customer enters delivery address at checkout
        3. Portal shows transport options:
           - Queries GET /shipping/transport-methods
           - Queries POST /shipping/cost for each option
           - Displays: "Air Freight: $45.50 (1-3 days)" etc.
        4. Customer selects preferred transport method (e.g., "air")
        5. Customer completes payment → Order #123 created
        6. Portal calls this endpoint with customer's selection
        
        Integration Flow:
        1. Order Management sends:
           - order_id, user_id, delivery_address, transport_type (customer choice), product IDs
        2. Logistics queries Stock module for EACH product:
           - GET /products/{id} → returns weight, dimensions, warehouse_postal_code
        3. Logistics validates:
           - All products exist in Stock
           - Sufficient stock available
           - Selected transport_type is valid
        4. Logistics calculates final shipping cost using customer's transport_type
        5. Creates shipment record with status 'created'
        6. Returns shipping_id to Order Management
        7. Order Management links shipping_id to Order #123
        
        Note: Stock module is the source of truth for:
        - Product dimensions and weight
        - Warehouse location (departure address)

        Customer Purchase Flow:
        1. Customer adds products to cart
        2. Customer enters delivery address
        3. Portal queries: GET /shipping/transport-methods (shows available options)
        4. Portal queries: POST /shipping/cost for each transport method (shows prices)
        5. Customer selects preferred transport method (air, road, rail, sea)
        6. Customer completes purchase → Order created
        7. Portal calls this endpoint with customer's selected transport_type
        
        Integration Flow:
        1. Order Management sends: order_id, user_id, delivery_address, transport_type, product IDs
        2. Logistics queries Stock module for each product:
           - Weight and dimensions (for cost calculation)
           - Warehouse location (departure_postal_code)
        3. Logistics validates selected transport_type is available
        4. Logistics calculates final cost using customer's selected transport method
        5. Creates shipment with status 'created'
        6. Returns shipping_id to Order Management
        
        Note: transport_type is chosen by the customer during checkout.
